    "# Setting a column based on another one and multiple conditions in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "This short notebook shows a way to set the value of one column in a CSV file, that satisfies multiple conditions, by extracting information from another column using regular expressions. The [pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is the best tool I know for programmatically working with CSV files. It offers many methods for modifying columns and supports different data types.\n",

    "While working on [ukealong.com](https://ukealong.com/), a website with more than 1,000 play along videos for the ukulele, I faced such a task. The meta data for the videos, which includes artists and track names is maintained in a CSV file. The source data comes from several YouTube channels, that create these play along videos. Let's look at a small subset of the data, that includes 10 records and only the relevant columns for demonstrating the column setting."

    "After running this code on the actual CSV file, most of the Ukulele Underground records showed the correct information in the two columns.\n",

    "In the [first published version](https://github.com/yaph/ipython-notebooks/blob/52dfed8d661e2e4b76abfea8a3b82c538a50ec5e/pandas-column-setting.ipynb) of this notebook I imported the standard library [re module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) and defined two custom functions using regular expressions to extract the information. Thanks to redditor [otterom](https://www.reddit.com/user/otterom/), who [made me aware](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/frpu36/setting_a_column_based_on_another_one_and/flyj66f/) of the `extract` method, the code is now more succinct and straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite frankly, writing the initial version of the code probably took longer than updating 100 records manually would have, let alone documenting the process in this notebook und updating it. On the other hand I can integrate the code in the process of adding new videos. Moreover, I learned something new, now have a reference for similar tasks in the future and it hopefully helps other people who face a similar problem.\n",

    "Last but not least, if you play the ukulele or want to learn it, I hope you'll dig [ukealong.com](https://ukealong.com/), share the site with your friends and show the creators of the play along videos some love by subscribing to their channels and liking their videos on YouTube. Playing music is really a joyful way to spend your time and helps to clear the mind in these times of uncertainty."
