    "# Automating Browser Screenshots for Social Media\n",
    "\n",
    "I have two websites, [ukealong.com](https://ukealong.com/) and [programminglanguages.info](https://programminglanguages.info/), with many pages showing graphics rendered with JavaScript. When I shared one of those pages on social media, I created a screenshot first, optimized the image and added the page URL as text to it. I realized that I don't want to do this manually for hundreds of pages and wrote some code to automate these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I looked at existing screenshot libraries for Python first, but the packages I tried didn't capture the dynamic graphics that I wanted to include on the screenshots. So I wrote a tool called [wcap (web page capture)](https://pypi.org/project/wcap/) that is built on top of [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver). It can be used as a command line tool or from within Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing `wcap` allows you to set the dimensions of the screenshot and a wait time in seconds to ensure that page rendering has finished. Any form of image manipulation like cropping or adding text has to be done separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you find the code to create the social media image for the [Key of C page on ukealong.com](https://ukealong.com/key/c/). The first step is to import the necessary libraries and set some display variables like margins and font size that are specific for the design and layout of the captured web page and the portion to show. My goal was to show the fretboard diagram and the first two rows of video preview images."
